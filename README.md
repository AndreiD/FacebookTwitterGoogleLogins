# Facebook Twitter Google Logins Samples

Android Facebook Twitter Google Logins

Sample app, trying to have the latest google/twitter/facebook logins code samples.

### 1. Email login

simple email / password login. material design. nothing fancy. nothing to configure

### 2. Twitter

Start by reading the documentation about fabric https://docs.fabric.io/android/twitter/authentication.html
You have to install the fabric plugin in android studio then work it from there.

### 3. Facebook

Create a facebook app and publish it. replace the facebook app id. generate the facebook keyhash (you have the function in the app). You should be good to go

### 4. Google

you have to give google the keyhash from your app and download a config json.


For all above, you have sample code that works & is tested.
